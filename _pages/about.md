Hi, I currently am a Masters student in Robotics. My technical interests primarily lie within control and computer vision for robotics.

Projects
======
## Autonomous robotic platform for object detection and retrieval

As part of the MSc team project, we are developing a robotic platform based on the Leo Rover 1.8 to autonomously detect and navigate towards differently coloured objects. The robot will carry the object using a manipulator and place the object in a bin that is of the same colour as the object. I am working on computer vision for the robot, which involves training and deploying the object detection model.

## C.U.B.O. (Cube Utilising Brutal Over-engineering)

An ongoing RoboSoc project, this team project involves designing an autonomous mechatronic system to solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube under 60 seconds. Our system features a customised mechanical holder for holding the cube, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for performing the computation for object detection. At the time of writing, we are working on circuit board design and the computer vision system.

## Biomedical Radar Device for Soft-tissue Imaging Research

Developed a prototype near-field radar imaging system for non-invasive soft-tissue imaging. I largely focused on writing the firmware for a Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-F28379D board and Arduino Uno board for phase-locked loop frequency generation and communication with a mechatronic rig, respectively.

## DSP-based musical reverb algorithms using Blackfin devices

Third-year individual project which implemented a reverberation algorithm, supervised by Prof. Patrick Gaydecki. The algorithm comprised digital comb filters, low pass filters and allpass filters to simulate direct and indirect sound reflections. An offline algorithm was programmed in Delphi and applied to .WAV files selected via a user interface. Real-time audio processing was achieved by programming an ADSP-BF706 EZ-KIT Mini Evaluation board with the algorithm and then applying it to an audio input.

## Embedded Systems Project

In this second-year team project, we developed an autonomous line-sensing buggy as a team. In terms of hardware, the buggy featured an STM32 microcontroller board to perform all the computing, an optical sensor array to detect the white line, motors, gearboxes and the customised chassis holding everything together. My duties involved writing the PID control algorithm to ensure that the buggy stayed on track and the design of the PCB incorporating the TCRT5000 sensor array.
