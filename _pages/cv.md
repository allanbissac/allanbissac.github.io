Projects
======
* Robotics Design Project: Developing a robotic platform based on the Leo Rover to autonomously detect and navigate towards differently coloured objects. Currently working on computer vision system.
* Fourth-year team project: Near-field Radar Measurement and Signal Processing System for Biomedical and Soft-tissue Imaging Research. Programmed a frequency synthesiser to generate microwave frequency signals for non-destructive scanning and wrote the driver to control the mechatronic rig
* Third-year project: DSP-based musical reverb algorithms using Blackfin devices. Developed a GUI to enable users to input audio files of .WAV format, customise reverberation parameters and output reverberated audio files. Implemented a program with same functionality for real-time processing using ADSP-BF706 evaluation board
* Embedded Systems Project: developed an autonomous line-sensing buggy as a team. Developed PID controller, worked on sensor array PCB design and motor characterisation
